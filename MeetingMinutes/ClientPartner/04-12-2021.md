## Topics Discussed
<b>EXPERIENCE USING SOFTWARE</b>
<ul>
  <li>Josh emailed the client the .msi installer.</li>
  <li>Logged in in devmode.</li>
  <li>Was seeing an "Enter all fields" alert box.</li>
  <li>We had to redo the .msi, because the .msi our client was using did not include latest bug fixes since yesterday's Mentor Meeting. These fixes include: new font showing up, new ECS hierarchy, the icons showing up, and the set refresh rate requiring a restart.</li>
</ul>

<b>Documentation</b>
<ul>
  <li>Recommended including in documentation steps of how we made the msi installer.</li>
</ul>

## Things Clarified
<ul>
  <li>Other than fixing bugs, doesn't want anything more out of the software.</li>
  <li>Doesn't expect the process of us handing the software over to him to be a complicated process.</li>
  <li>Discussed Accutech's hiring junior developers, and Accutech's new building in Muncie.</li>
</ul>
