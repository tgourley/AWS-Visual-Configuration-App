## Minute Recorder

Wyatt

## Topics Discussed
- We met with our client, Trey Gourley, and informed him that we had not yet made the releases/tags for "SignOff" which would take a few minutes. He didn't have a problem with this; he didn't want this final release. He just wanted us to transfer the GitHub repository to him so that he could have access to our documentation and MSI. He was the owner of the GitLab repository, which contained our source code, so we didn't have to transfer this to him.

## Things Clarified
- We discussed Accutech's opening for Junior Software Developer, and the submission/response involved with that.
