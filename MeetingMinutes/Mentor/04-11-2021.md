## Topics Discussed
We gave our mentor our MSI installer. We let him use our software, and he gave us the following feedback:<br>
- The RDS dashboard item had a resizing bug
- Our program crashes if the user enters bad AWS credentials
- Recommended we get rid of the option to delete and duplicate dashboard items
- Recommended more color, color coding, like the dashboard item corresponds to the object explorer in its color
- Multiple Settings windows can be opened up
- Recommended we use a different hierarchy of ECS items

## Things Clarified
- We agreed we should update the screenshots in our documentation, as well as add info about the MSI installer in the documentation.
