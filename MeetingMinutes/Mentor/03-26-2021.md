## Topics Discussed
- We reiterated to our mentor about what we were planning on accomplishing for this iteration and any hangups associated with
them. As far as our custom msi installer approach, we discussed the potential fallback if we coulddn't find a reliable application
that was free online to use, that we would resort to what Benjamin knows how to do with a barebones approach to creating a basic
non-custom msi.

## Things Clarified
- We clarified our time table from today into the coming weeks with the student symposium and iteration 5 completion due dates.
Everyone went over where they were indivdually in this iteration and projected when these tasks would be complete.
