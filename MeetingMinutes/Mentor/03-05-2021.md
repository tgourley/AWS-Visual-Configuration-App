## Topics Discussed
- EXPERIENCE USING OUR SOFTWARE: ECS and S3 need better stylization/too flat. Would like tooltips for buttons. Thought the animations were too slow. Wants only one Settings Window to be opened, as he could open multiple Settings Windows.
- No comments on documentation.

## Things Clarified
- For Iteration 5: Thought that logging should be more thorough than just loggin over access. Recommended we try to do an installer. Said that would make our project more sleek, refined.
