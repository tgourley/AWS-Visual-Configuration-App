## Topics Discussed
- Mentor recommended we start regularly doing code reviews with our PRs. He suggested we discuss and come to agreement on how we're going to do code reviews. We might do it once a week, for example.
- We discussed our recent communications with our client (regarding permissions for Accutech's AWS environment and the required JSON file). Mentor recommended we take a crack at it.
- We discussed the new changes to our project (the mock API).
- No comments on documentation.

## Things Clarified
- As of now, the only thing we have planned for Iteration 4 is error logging. We planned on setting our Iteration 4 goals after our next client meeting.
- We clarified what all we're doing this iteration, and who is doing what.
