## Topics Discussed
- After discussing the issues we're facing with the ECS tree, mentor's idea got us pointed in the right direction. Involves nested API calls. A bit too technical to fully explain here.
- Mentor suggested that we go ahead and implement start/stop functionality, even though that functionality is only available for a couple services.
- Mentor suggested we consider caching.
- No comments on documentation.

## Things Clarified
- We went through our Iteration 4 goals on GitHub and prioritized them. Mentor didn't feel error logging was as important as logout/make UI look nicer.
