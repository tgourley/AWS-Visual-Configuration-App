## Topics Discussed
- Mentor recommended a method of UI testing where, for example, we call a specific function, and that function creates three new nodes when called. He recommended this rather than writing tests to fire up the UI, making it click on things, etc.
- Besides that, Ben said it looks great.
- For all documentation, said it looks good.

## Things Clarified
- We further clarified our goals for Iteration 3 (which later got changed in the client meeting):
-  At least 2 new AWS services
-  Auto-refresh
-  Buttons to start and stop instances
-  Refactor our handlers, make more modular
-  Hover pop ups with additional info on instances
