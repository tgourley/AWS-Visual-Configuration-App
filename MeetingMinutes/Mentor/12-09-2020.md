## Topics Discussed
<ul>
<li>We discussed that our master branch is the same as Iteration 1, with no changes, because we are working on different feature branches, which are almost but not completely finished yet.</li> 
<li>We discussed the new project structure, where we have model, view, and controller on exclusive layers.</li>
<li>Mentor recommended we start doing pull requests, as this is a common practice in the field.</li>
<li>We discussed future iterations. For Iteration 3, we would like to implement a link to the real AWS console, in case the user would want to do that for any reason. Also implement 3-4 more AWS Services, and an auto-refresh feature, which was what the client originally had in mind.</li>
</ul>

## Things Clarified
<ul>
<li>We agreed that in future iterations, the burden of testing will fall on the developer. Whoever writes production code will test that production code, rather than having someone write all the tests.</li>
<li>Over break, we don't plan on working on the software, but we would like to use break to learn more about AWS, specifically research into the AWS services we have yet to cover.</li>
</ul>
