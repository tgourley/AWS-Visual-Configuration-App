## Topics Discussed

We discussed the feedback from our mentor. We discussed the First Iteration release, as well as releases after that, which features we want to implement early, and which features are "icing on the cake items", additional features that would be nice, but are not essential, such as allowing the user to customize the color scheme of the software.

## Things Clarified

At the next client meeting, we want to ask the client which two or three services we should tackle for the First Iteration. While we initially agreed on a desktop application, we had another discussion on why this would be better for this project than a web application.
