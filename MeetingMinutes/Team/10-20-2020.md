## Topics Discussed

We discussed the feedback from our mentor. We discussed what we'd like to have accomplished for each of our future iterations (not just the first iteration). We discussed which features we want to implement early, and which features are "icing on the cake items", to implement later. These are additional features that would be nice, but are not essential, such as allowing the user to customize the color scheme of the software.

## Things Clarified

At the next client meeting, we want to ask the client which two or three services we should tackle for the First Iteration. We are thinking that these two or three services might also be the most commonly-used AWS services. While we initially agreed on making this project a desktop application, we had another discussion on desktop versus web, and we ultimately clarified that, yes, we do want this project to be a desktop application.
