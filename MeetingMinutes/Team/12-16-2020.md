## Topics Discussed

We discussed the iteration 3 features assignment and went over our presentation for our meeting with Dr. Ergin on Thursday.
We also discussed who is going to prioritize what for the next iteration and to keep everyone updated over break if they find
something out that could be beneficial to the project.

## Things Clarified

We clarified what needed to been done to finish this week and subsequently this semester off as far as assignments and the final
