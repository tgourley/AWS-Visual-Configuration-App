## Topics Discussed

We watched three other groups' presentations: Full Court Analytics, 24x7 System Monitoring, and Offline Video Editing. Watching all of them took a little over an hour, nobody was taking notes, and a couple people had to go, so later we wrote out our thoughts on the presentations in a Google Doc.

## Things Clarified

We discussed individual strengths for the upcoming project, but still aren't totally sure yet about how we're going to break up tasks. We plan to start coding soon. We plan to do more investigation into AWS, as well as read notes on AWS our client said he would prepare for us.
