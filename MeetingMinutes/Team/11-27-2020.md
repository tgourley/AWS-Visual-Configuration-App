## Topics Discussed

- Somebody called our team member Benjamin Furlani, and said that we can get free access to SyncFusion, because we're using it for education purposes.
- We would like to get .NET 5 for Iteration 2. It's got some cool features. Right now, we're using .NET CORE 3.1.

## Things Clarified

- We clarified that we won't establish our Iteration 2 goals until after the Iteration 1 meeting with our client, Trey Gourley.
- We agreed to use Google Slides for the presentation for Iteration Day.
