## Topics Discussed

Many topics were discussed, including project classes/structure, AWS IAM accounts, the ID number for our own IAM account, AWS SDK, and how that removes the need to build our own API through API Gateway, AWS SDK's packages for EC2, S3, etc. We used to think that SyncFusion only had a free 30-day option, but we discovered that a free community license does exist. We're considering allowing the user to select right off the bat which things they want to see, so that we're not making a bunch of unnecessary calls, calls for things the user doesn't care about.

## Things Clarified

We divvied up tasks, and clarified who is doing what for the next week. Benjamin is going to work on API/backend. Joshua is going to start on the UI. Nick is going to look into C# MOQ. Noah is going to work on documentation. Wyatt is going to work on a "bus station" class, a class in between the UI and the API stuff, which will have functions for different EC2 calls. We're shooting to have this completed by Friday of next week. That way, we have a couple days for polish/finishing touches.
