## Topics Discussed

We discussed short-term goals for this week as far as what everyone is doing for the project indivudually. These things
will include changing any documentation in Github in compliance with the feedback recieved from our mentor, client, and professor
over the past week. We also discussed a plan for getting the "Compare your team with others" completed before the end of this
week.

## Things Clarified

For getting started with the backend we will all need to make sure we have Visual Studio code with the .NET core installed. Ben
will presumably be the frontrunner in getting it started since he has the most experience with .NET core in the group, to which
everyone else has no experience. We decided that for the sake of the grade we would start on the backend despite our client
favoring the approach of starting with the visualization first due to the level of difficulty it presents.
