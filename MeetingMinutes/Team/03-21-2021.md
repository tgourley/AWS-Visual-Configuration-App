## Topics Discussed
- We may have found a framework for testing our Syncfusion UI. We just found it, not yet sure if it will do the job.
- Josh's place of employment has a method of testing UI. If the aforementioned framework is a no-go, we'll give this a shot.

## Things Clarified
- We haven't put any thought into our Student Symposium video. We agreed we should start thinking of presentation ideas.
- Upon research, we're not sure which custom installer our client was talking about. We'll have to email him.
