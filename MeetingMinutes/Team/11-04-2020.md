## Topics Discussed

We discussed NuGet, because we're installing AWS .NET CORE and SDK through NuGet. We discussed how NuGet is like Gradle in that it manages dependencies. We discussed some documentation we found for this SDK, which is good documentation with example code. We discussed how Atlassian is for tracking project progress/tasks. Our project repo is on GitLab, a repo Benjamin created. We've cloned it in Visual Studio successfully.

## Things Clarified

Our client said he would provide us with a dummy AWS environment to work with. We don't have this environment yet. We agreed that as of now, our project is at a standstill until we have an AWS environment to work with. Even for the UI/front end, we want a real environment to work with, so that we're not hard-coding a bunch of XML files and such. We plan to ask the client for the dummy environment, and if we don't get it within a week, we will create our own environment, an AWS account for all 5 group members to share.
