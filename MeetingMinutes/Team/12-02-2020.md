## Topics Discussed

We discussed timeline of the iteration 2 and confirmed who is tasked with doing what. We discussed potentially letting our client
Trey know about the timeline which is from now until Dec. 14, just to make sure he knows we have a short time with this iteration
to keep his expectations in the right spot. 

## Things Clarified

We clarified what we needed to implement for this iteration and to make sure that we all have enough time individually to work
on it. Everything else clarified was within the scope of details regarding how and what to do when coding the ECS and RDS instances
along with not implementing the common shared interface until the next iteration.
