## Minute Recorder

Wyatt

## Topics Discussed

We discussed the latest emails from our client, Trey Gourley, in which he said to skip ECS for this iteration, as ECS is not free-tier. Because Wyatt and Nick planned on working on ECS, they now have to find other things to work on for this iteration.

## Things Clarified

We clarified who is doing what for this iteration. Tasks:
- Josh: refactoring handler classes
- Ben: interfaces, mock refreshes
- Noah: S3
- Nick: looking into IAM roles and JSON files (This is in the hopes of accessing Accutech's AWS environment.)
- Wyatt: stop/start button. Will switch to doing Route 53 if this turns out to not be feasible.
