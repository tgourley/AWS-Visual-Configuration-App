## Topics Discussed
- We went over everything that's due this upcoming week: our Closure Presentation, which we are preparing in Google Slides, the time we present (Tues at 4:00 PM), the Capstone Showcase, the Capstone Showcase presentation, our meeting with our client, and Closure Tasks.

## Things Clarified
- We arranged to meet with our client Thurs at 4:30 PM. We expect the handing-off process to be pretty straightforward, as our client owns the source code repository.
