## Topics Discussed
- Planning to meet with our client tomorrow. We feel this meeting is important, as we're finalizing what he wants to see for Iteration 5, the final product. We planned on meeting with our mentor today to discuss this meeting (as our mentor emphasized he wanted to discuss Iteration 5 features with us before we meet with our client), but unfortunately mentor couldn't make the meeting today.
- Bugs we're encountering with visualizing ECS connections
- Resolving issues with the recent Route 53 merge
- The 11 AWS updates
- NuGet updates
- Adding Route 53 to the UI
- Logging needs to be added to the Documentation

## Things Clarified
- We'll all be on tomorrow night for finalizing/running tests/updates/etc.
