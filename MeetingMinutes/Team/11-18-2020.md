## Topics Discussed

Noah had some questions over development documentation, what all dependencies and packages we have, and how NuGet works. We discussed unit tests, which should not require logging in to make and run. There should be a unit test for each scenario, what if the function is passed what is expected, what if it's passed something unexpected, etc. We discussed a feature of the recently-released .NET 5 that will make environment replication easier.

## Things Clarified

We clarified that we should not release to the public our keys and such for the IAM account we're using. Nor should we publically release a link to our GitLab, which our client has set to private. Noah was going to link the group with a Google Drive folder for what he has so far. We are aiming to be done with this project by Friday, so we're not stressing out on Sunday trying to wrap things up.
