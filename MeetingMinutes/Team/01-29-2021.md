## Topics Discussed

We talked about our continuing work with creating the mock clients for all of our AWS services and more specifically how
the ECS mock client will work considering how ECS operates within its tiers of systems. This is a change from last week as
when our last meeting occured we had started the mock client idea.

## Things Clarified

We clarified that for this iteration going forward we would have to change the things we had planned on originally submitting
for the iteration. The iteration now is focused on getting the mock clients working and testable, and also implementing
S3 (Noah) with the same mock process. We also discussed what Ben had told us in our mentor meeting regarding our DevMode
functionality and decided to implement his advice for it if time permits, otherwise roll it over to the next iteration.
