## Topics Discussed
We went through a checklist for Iteration 3: what's done and what's left to do. We have a bit of documentation left to do, in User Documentation specifically, for the Auto Refresh functionality. Wyatt is having difficulty adding screenshots to Development Documentation, which Josh might look at tomorrow, since he's away from his computer today. We started our presentation slideshow today, and we plan to spend tomorrow reviewing our materials before turning in.

## Things Clarified
We agreed on a time for Iteration Day that works for all of us: Thursday at 9AM. We're not entirely sure who is doing what for the next iteration, but Nick wants to take on Route 53 (new AWS service).
