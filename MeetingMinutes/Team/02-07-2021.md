## Topics Discussed
We essentially just reviewed what we have for Iteration 3: what's done, what's left to do, etc. We have a bit of documentation left to do, in User, for the Auto Refresh functionality. We started our presentation slideshow today, and plan to spend tomorrow reviewing everything before turning in.

## Things Clarified
We agreed on a time for Iteration Day that works for all of us: Thursday at 9AM. We're not sure who all is doing what for the next iteration, but Nick wants to take on Route 53 (new AWS service).
