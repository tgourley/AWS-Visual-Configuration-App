## Topics Discussed

We agreed on making this project a desktop application, rather than a web application.

Within the next week, we will: sketch UI prototypes and upload to GitHub, learn about C# (if new to it), learn about our given AWS services, get a free AWS account, and make sure we have Visual Studio (not VS Code).
