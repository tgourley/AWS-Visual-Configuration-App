## Topics Discussed
- We discussed the Student Symposium presentation, due tomorrow at midnight. As of now, we have screenshots of our application uploaded as items to our Omeka Collection (though not yet as an exhibit, which is the last step). We have a script written up for our video, as well as images and clips for our video.
- In uploading screenshots as items to Omeka, we noticed there was no option for making the items public. This must not be an issue on our part, as all seen uploaded items from other users/projects are set to "private" as well.

## Things Clarified
- We'll record the audio for our Student Symposium presentation tomorrow, with each of us taking turns reading off a script.
