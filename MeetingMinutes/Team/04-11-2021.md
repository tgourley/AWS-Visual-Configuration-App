## Topics Discussed
- We worked out an issue with fonts. We're using a new font for our dashboard items, and Josh was having difficulty getting it to show up on his machine.
- Amazon released a massive SDK update, for multiple services. We got everything updated, and verified that the installer still works correctly.

## Things Clarified
- Tomorrow we'll meet with our client at 6:00 PM.
- Additionally, we plan to update our documentation with new screenshots, as our UI looks different now.
