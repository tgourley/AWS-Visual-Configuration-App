# Business Requirements
<ul>
<li><b>BR1: Reduce the time the business spends on finding desired information about AWS services.</b><br/>Our ultimate goal in developing this software is to develop a way to get and display information about AWS services that is quicker than using the consoles provided by AWS. If the software we deliver enables the user to see desired AWS information quicker than using AWS’s consoles, then our goal is met, and our product is a success. If the software we deliver does not enable the user to do this, then our goal is not met, and our product is a failure. This requirement does not have a specific measurement. For instance, our goal is not to create a product that enables the user to see desired information 50% quicker than using AWS consoles.</li>
<li><b>BR2: Visualize the business’s multiple AWS services in one place, getting rid of the need to switch among various AWS consoles.</b><br/>In order to achieve our ultimate goal, the software we deliver must enable the user to find desired AWS information faster than AWS consoles can. This shall be accomplished by making information from multiple AWS services available on one screen, in one location, as opposed to AWS consoles, where each service has its own console, making the information spread out among multiple locations.</li>
