# AWS-Visual-Configuration-App-Domain-Model

For this Domain Model we used five of the many AWS tools that could potentially end up within our AWS Dashboard application. The reasoing behind this is that since there
so many AWS tools, it would be redundant to add them all, and the implemntation for all of them would stay relatively the same.

The five AWS tools displayed in this domain model are:
- EC2
- SES
- RDS
- AWS Lambda
- S3
