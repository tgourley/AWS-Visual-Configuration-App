# AWS-Visual-Configuration-App-Domain-Model

For this Domain Model we used five of the many AWS tools that could potentially end up within our AWS Dashboard application. The reasoing behind this is that since there
so many AWS tools, it would be redundant to add them all, and the implemntation for all of them would stay relatively the same. We chose these five tools for our domain model because they are among some of the higher priority AWS tools that our client wants included on the dashboard sooner than later.

The five AWS tools displayed in this domain model are:
- EC2
- SES
- RDS
- AWS Lambda
- S3


**EC2 Class:**
EC2 is a web service that provides sercure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 is one of the tools commonly used by our client, thus is included with the AWS dashboard. Unlike AWS Lambda, with EC2 you have more flexibility and can customize what language you need to use in conjunction with elastic beanstalk.


**SES Class:**
SES is a cost-effective, flexible, and scalable email service that enables developers to send mail from within any application. SES is another commonly used tool for our client and is a priority for iteration 1 of our dashboard.


**RDS Class:**
RDS makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficent and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming admin tasks.


**AWS Lambda Class:**
AWS Lambda lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.


**S3 Class:**
S3 or Simple Storage Service is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data avalibility, security, and performance. S3 can also transfer files seamlessly from an S3 bucket to an RDS instance.
