# AWS-Visual-Configuration-App-Domain-Model

For this Domain Model we used five of the many AWS tools that could potentially end up within our AWS Dashboard application. The reasoing behind this is that since there
so many AWS tools, it would be redundant to add them all, and the implemntation for all of them would stay relatively the same.

The five AWS tools displayed in this domain model are:
- EC2
- SES
- RDS
- AWS Lambda
- S3

```
EC2 Class:
EC2 is a web service that provides sercure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 is one of the tools commonly used by our client, thus is included with the AWS dashboard.
```
```
SES Class:
SES is a cost-effective, flexible, and scalable email service that enables developers to send mail from within any application. SES is another commonly used tool for our client and is a priority for iteration 1 of our dashboard.
```
```
RDS Class:
```
```
AWS Lambda Class:
```
```
S3 Class:
```
