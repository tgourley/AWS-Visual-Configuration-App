# AWS Visual Configuration App Prototype

For this design prototype we incorporated as many of the client's requests as we could possibly do.  The key focus was "eliminating clicks" while also providing a clean, attractive interface for an AWS user or administrator to utilize for handling various AWS items.  The below items are summaries of key focuses that are featured in the prototype linked; they are explained fully in the linked video.  These focuses are listed in descending order of importance.

<ul>
<li><b>Focus 1:</b> Make sure the app can handle all actions desired by the client on <b>one</b> screen.  The screen can have a few different depths to particular items, but ultimately we need to keep control within the dashboard whenever possible</li>
<li><b>Focus 2:</b> Eliminate clicks, or actions, to get to desired information or control options.</li>
<li><b>Focus 3:</b> The client requested an easy-to-read, intuitive display.  We have incorporated color representation for AWS type, status, and readouts, as well as a legend for ascertaining what is what, in case immediate user intuition fails.</li>
<li><b>Focus 4:</b> The client made it seem as though his AWS usage would probably evolve in the future, so we needed to add the ability to customize how some information is presented.  This is so that the client can give priority to which items are presented at the forefront (top) of the page, and which colors are used for each item.</li>
<li><b>Focus 5:</b> The client specifically requested the use of ellipsoid shapes multiple times, so we have been sure to incorporate them.</li>
</ul>
